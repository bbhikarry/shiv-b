# A little bit of power

 >Is a bitter thrill.  
 
 Let's begin this journey. Why are we programming? Odds are its the need to interface with a computer given so much people use the things.  As you've found out, text languages are easier to work with (that's why so much programming languages exist).
 
 We are about to learn R, a programming language but we are also going to use (R) inside an Integrated Developer Environment. This is called RStudio.
 
 Your required reading now is to familiarise yourself and write down (use [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)) a brief description as to R's reason for being. Forget the technical stuff, just say what its used for - and by whom.
 
### Rstudio

You should already have this IDE installed - on top of the R programme.

### Modus

Every time we meet the following structure applies: We'll begin at the top and work down the list

1. **Remember**. Recall facts and basic concepts [*define, duplicate, list, memorise, repeat, state*]

1. **Understand**. Explain ideas or concepts [*classify, descrie, discuss, explain, identify, locate, recognise, report, select, translate*]

1. **Apply**. Use information in new situations [*execute,implement, solve, use, demonstrate, interpret, operate, schedule, sketch*]

1. **Analyse**. Draw connections among new ideas [*differentiate, organise, relate, compare, contrast, distinguish, examine, experiment, question, test*]

1. **Evaluate**. Justify a stand or decision [appraise, argue, defend, judge, select, support, value, critique, weigh]

1. **Create** Produce a new or original work [*Design, assemble, construct, conjecture, develop, formulate, author, investigate*]
