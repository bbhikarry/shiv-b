<h1>A little bit of power</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Is a bitter thrill.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Let’s begin this journey. Why are we programming? Odds are its the need to interface with a computer given so much people use the things. As you’ve found out, text languages are easier to work with (that’s why so much programming languages exist).</p>
<p>We are about to learn R, a programming language but we are also going to use (R) inside an Integrated Developer Environment. This is called RStudio.</p>
<p>Your required reading now is to familiarise yourself and write down (use <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/">Markdown</a>) a brief description as to R’s reason for being. Forget the technical stuff, just say what its used for - and by whom.</p>
<div id="rstudio" class="section level3">
<h3>Rstudio</h3>
<p>You should already have this IDE installed - on top of the R programme.</p>

<h3>Modus</h3>
<p>Every time we meet the following structure applies: We’ll begin at the top and work down the list</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Remember</strong>. Recall facts and basic concepts [<em>define, duplicate, list, memorise, repeat, state</em>]</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Understand</strong>. Explain ideas or concepts [<em>classify, descrie, discuss, explain, identify, locate, recognise, report, select, translate</em>]</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Apply</strong>. Use information in new situations [<em>execute,implement, solve, use, demonstrate, interpret, operate, schedule, sketch</em>]</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Analyse</strong>. Draw connections among new ideas [<em>differentiate, organise, relate, compare, contrast, distinguish, examine, experiment, question, test</em>]</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Evaluate</strong>. Justify a stand or decision [appraise, argue, defend, judge, select, support, value, critique, weigh]</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Create</strong> Produce a new or original work [<em>Design, assemble, construct, conjecture, develop, formulate, author, investigate</em>]</p></li>
</ol>
